# spring-boot-job-monitor
Spring Boot Job Monitor is a lightweight starter library that enables automatic monitoring of job executions in Spring Boot applications. It supports both in-memory and JDBC-based storage, exposes logs through REST endpoints, and can optionally integrate with Prometheus for observability â€” all with zero configuration from the client side.
